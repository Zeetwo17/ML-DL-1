# ML-DL-1 — Transformer-based French→English MT (with Web App)

A small, educational project exploring **sequence-to-sequence machine translation** with a **Transformer**. The repo includes experiment & final Jupyter notebooks for **French→English** MT, helper Python modules, and a simple web app scaffold. It also ships the seminal paper, *Attention Is All You Need*, for reference.
